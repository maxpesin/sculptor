							<p>The theory behind sculpt is simnple; rotate exercises each routine to remove the possibility of a plateau. Each large muscle gorup divided into key areas and each key area holds X number of exercises. Each rotated routine is unique due to the different quantity of exercises per muscle group. In sum, we dont only rotate the routines, but rather, we are challanged with different routine variations each time we use Sculptor!</p>

							<p>To fully adapt to Sculptor one must journey thorugh a huge learning curve! Some are not ready for all exercises, dont worry, we'll build you up to them. Others may have injuries impeding specific exercises, dont worry we opt out, temporarily and permanatly. With the use of sculptor you will never neglect a single muscle fibre in your body. Sculpt your self to the extent that nature created you!</p>
